# Overview
This project is a Terraform module that creates an S3 bucket that moves its objects into archival storage (Glacier) after a period of time.

# Guidebook
Details about this project are contained in the [guidebook](guidebook/guidebook.adoc) and should be considered mandatory reading prior to contributing to this project.

# Prerequisites
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) installed and working
* Development and testing was done on [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

# Building
Since this is just a collection of Terraform scripts, there is nothing to build.

# Installation
This module is not installed but, instead, is obtained by the project using the module.  See [kurron/terraform-environments](https://github.com/kurron/terraform-environments) for example usage.

# Tips and Tricks

## Debugging
The `debug` folder contains files that can be used to test out local changes to the module.  Edit `backend.cfg` and `plan.tf` to your liking and then run `debug/debug-module.sh` to test your changes.

## Usage
This module, unlike many of my other modules, provides default values for many of the options. I decided to this because I felt it was too cumbersome to expect a user to supply 10+ properties.  Make sure to examine the `variables.tf` to see the full list of configurable options.  Look at `debug/plan.tf` for an example of how to call the module.

# Troubleshooting

## Name Selection
The `name` attribute is used to name the bucket and is also applied to the `Name` tag.  Buckets can only contain lowercase characters and hyphens.  The module will automatically convert the name to lowercase but you must use hyphens appropriately.
